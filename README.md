# Computational Modelling Book Club
An virtual book club on  Farrell and Lewandowsky's (2018) book, "Computational modeling of cognition and behavior". We study, discuss and exchange thoughts on the methods of compuational modelling. Here we provide our implementation, using Python codes to replicate the models and algorithms explained in the book.

# Useful Real-life Examples
The book introduces many important concepts in computational modelling and provides useful R (and MATLAB in 2010 version) scripts to help the reader understand the concepts. However, very often, some gaps exist between the scripts presented in the pedagogical form and the scripts found in the real-life projects. Here is a list of examples using computational models to answer scientific questions or tackle real-life problems. One of the criteria that I list them here is that the authors not only release their data but also their analysed codes.

- Of course, see my other repositories for other real-life examples.
